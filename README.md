# Oil-Company-Region-Selection
OilyGiant Mining Co is looking for the next location to develop for oil well drilling. Machine learning and bootstrapping is used to determine the most profitable choice. 

The code for the preprocessing, EDA and model training/evaluation can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file.

The data is taken from: 
- geo_data_0.csv
- geo_data_1.csv
- geo_data_2.csv

The requirements.txt file displays the necessary library and package versions needed for pushing the code to github. 

The following libraries and packages are used in this project:
- pandas as pd
- numpy as np
- numpy.random RandomState
- scipy stats as st
- sklearn.model_selection train_test_split and LinearRegression
- sklearn.metrics mean_squared_error

This jupyter notebook works locally and on hosted notebook servers. Simply open the "Oil Company Region Selection.ipynb" file.
